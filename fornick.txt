Dear Listeners,
you just listened to a stream of a stream by Mill River. To find more about the track go to streamofstream.github.io thank you and have a nice evening.



Dear Listeners, 

Everyone should be quiet by a little stream and listen is an ongoing gathering of river streams recordings. Each river stream is recorded with an underwater microphone and uploaded to a free music streaming service. The sound of river streams - the natural flow of water becomes a steady, continuous flow of data transmitting over the internet. Metaphor becomes itself.

There the sound of river streams - the natural flow of water metamorphoses into a steady, continuous flow of data transmitting over the internet. Stream of a stream. What does it mean?
  I don't  have an aswer to that, but I find it fascinating to thing about. Since forever people manipulated the flow of the water on earth to fertilize crops or to avoid floodings. We builded mills around the streams. Now when I think of stream I think of streaming music, movies or news, how is this one different to the stream? Do we too manipulate streams of data inside the network? Do we to build  mills on them to generate power, but what kind of power? Do we change their shape so they stream in a different direction to prevent flooding  or to fertizilize certain crop?  The digital stream may feel easier to prevent catastrophe  rather  than with a natural stream, but somehow I feel like drowning.
